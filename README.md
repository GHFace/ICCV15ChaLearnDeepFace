# ICCV15ChaLearnDeepFace

Code of the paper 'Hu, Guosheng, et al. When Face Recognition Meets with Deep Learning: an Evaluation of Convolutional Neural Networks for Face Recognition, ICCV2015 workshop, 2015'.

Our implementation is based on MatConvNet developed by VGG group, Oxford University.

Three models (CNN-S, CNN-M, CNN-L) introduced in the paper are trained using the three script files (cnn_lfw_model_single_1.m, cnn_lfw_model_single_2.m and  cnn_lfw_model_single_3.m) respectively.
